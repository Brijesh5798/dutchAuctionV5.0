# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic DutchAuction use case. It accepts hight bid of ERC20 token name Bid tokens, and transfer the NFT to bidder from owner and this version of dutchAuction is upgradable we can use proxy to upgrade this smart contracts.

We used ERC20 permit to use off chain signing to approve auction contract to spend token from user's wallet.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
